Summary
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of technology with potentially significant
implications for national security. As such, the United States and other nations are developing AI
applications for a range of military functions. AI research is underway in the fields of intelligence
collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, command and control,
and in a variety of semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. Already, AI has been incorporated
into military operations in Iraq and Syria. Congressional action has the potential to shape the
technology’s development further, with budgetary and legislative decisions influencing the
growth of military applications as well as the pace of their adoption.
AI technologies present unique challenges for military integration, particularly because the bulk
of AI development is happening in the commercial sector. Although AI is not unique in this
regard, the defense acquisition process may need to be adapted for acquiring emerging
technologies like AI. In addition, many commercial AI applications must undergo significant
modification prior to being functional for the military. A number of cultural issues also challenge
AI acquisition, as some commercial AI companies are averse to partnering with the Department
of Defense (DOD) due to ethical concerns, and even within the department, there can be
resistance to incorporating AI technology into existing weapons systems and processes.
Potential international rivals in the AI market are creating pressure for the United States to
compete for innovative military AI applications. China is a leading competitor in this regard,
releasing a plan in 2017 to capture the global lead in AI development by 2030. Currently, China is
primarily focused on using AI to make faster and more well-informed decisions, as well as on
developing a variety of autonomous military vehicles. Russia is also active in military AI
development, with a primary focus on robotics.
Although AI has the potential to impart a number of advantages in the military context, it may
also introduce distinct challenges. AI technology could, for example, facilitate autonomous
operations, lead to more informed military decisionmaking, and increase the speed and scale of
military action. However, it may also be unpredictable or vulnerable to unique forms of
manipulation. As a result of these factors, analysts hold a broad range of opinions on how
influential AI will be in future combat operations. While a small number of analysts believe that
the technology will have minimal impact, most believe that AI will have at least an
evolutionary—if not revolutionary—effect.
Military AI development presents a number of potential issues for Congress:
        What is the right balance of commercial and government funding for AI
         development?
        How might Congress influence defense acquisition reform initiatives that
         facilitate military AI development?
        What changes, if any, are necessary in Congress and DOD to implement effective
         oversight of AI development?
        How should the United States balance research and development related to
         artificial intelligence and autonomous systems with ethical considerations?
        What legislative or regulatory changes are necessary for the integration of
         military AI applications?
        What measures can Congress take to help manage the AI competition globally?

Introduction1
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of technology that is capturing the attention
of commercial investors, defense intellectuals, policymakers, and international competitors alike,
as evidenced by a number of recent initiatives. On July 20, 2017, the Chinese government
released a strategy detailing its plan to take the lead in AI by 2030. Less than two months later
Vladimir Putin publicly announced Russia’s intent to pursue AI technologies, stating, “[W]hoever
becomes the leader in this field will rule the world.”2 Similarly, the U.S. National Defense
Strategy, released in January 2018, identified artificial intelligence as one of the key technologies
that will “ensure [the United States] will be able to fight and win the wars of the future.”3
The U.S. military is already integrating AI systems into combat via a spearhead initiative called
Project Maven, which has used AI algorithms to identify insurgent targets in Iraq and Syria.4
These dynamics raise several questions that have been addressed in congressional hearings: What
types of military AI applications are possible, and what limits, if any, should be imposed? What
unique advantages and vulnerabilities come with employing AI for defense? How will AI change
warfare, and what influence will it have on the military balance with U.S. competitors? Congress
has a number of oversight, budgetary, and legislative tools available that it may use to influence
the answers to these questions and shape the future development of AI technology.


AI Terminology and Background5
Almost all academic studies in artificial intelligence acknowledge that no commonly accepted
definition of AI exists, in part because of the diverse approaches to research in the field.
Likewise, although Section 238 of the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
directs the Secretary of Defense to produce a definition of artificial intelligence by August 13,
2019, no official U.S. government definition of AI yet exists.6 The FY2019 NDAA does,
however, provide a definition of AI for the purposes of Section 238:
    1. Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and unpredictable
       circumstances without significant human oversight, or that can learn from
       experience and improve performance when exposed to data sets.
    2. An artificial system developed in computer software, physical hardware, or other
       context that solves tasks requiring human-like perception, cognition, planning,
       learning, communication, or physical action.

    3. An artificial system designed to think or act like a human, including cognitive
       architectures and neural networks.
    4. A set of techniques, including machine learning that is designed to approximate a
       cognitive task.
    5. An artificial system designed to act rationally, including an intelligent software
       agent or embodied robot that achieves goals using perception, planning,
       reasoning, learning, communicating, decision-making, and acting.7
This definition encompasses many of the descriptions in Table 1 below, which summarizes
various AI definitions in academic literature.
The field of AI research began in the 1940s, but an explosion of interest in AI began around 2010
due to the convergence of three enabling developments: (1) the availability of “big data” sources,
(2) improvements to machine learning approaches, and (3) increases in computer processing
power.8 This growth has advanced the state of Narrow AI, which refers to algorithms that address
specific problem sets like game playing, image recognition, and navigation. All current AI
systems fall into the Narrow AI category. The most prevalent approach to Narrow AI is machine
learning, which involves statistical algorithms that replicate human cognitive tasks by deriving
their own procedures through analysis of large training data sets.9 During the training process, the
computer system creates its own statistical model to accomplish the specified task in situations it
has not previously encountered.
Experts generally agree that it will be many decades before the field advances to develop General
AI, which refers to systems capable of human-level intelligence across a broad range of tasks.10
Nevertheless, the rapid advancements in Narrow AI have sparked a wave of investment, with U.S.
venture capitalists raising an estimated $18.5 billion for AI research in 2019 alone.11 Similarly,
DOD’s unclassified investments in AI have grown from just over $600 million in FY2016 to $2.5
billion in FY2021 (including investments in autonomy), with the Department reportedly
maintaining over 600 active AI projects.12

reason in pursuit of that task.”

AI has a number of unique characteristics that may be important to consider as these technologies
enter the national security arena. First, AI has the potential to be integrated across a variety of
applications, improving the so-called “Internet of Things” in which disparate devices are
networked together to optimize performance.13 As Kevin Kelley, the founder of Wired magazine,
states, “[AI] will enliven inert objects, much as electricity did more than a century ago.
Everything that we formerly electrified we will now cognitize.”14 Second, many AI applications
are dual-use, meaning they have both military and civil applications. For example, image
recognition algorithms can be trained to recognize cats in YouTube videos as well as terrorist
activity in full motion video captured by uninhabited aerial vehicles over Syria or Afghanistan.15
Third, AI is a relatively transparent enabling capability, meaning that its integration into a product
may not be immediately recognizable. By and large, AI procurement will not result in countable
objects. Rather, the algorithm will be purchased separately and incorporated into a larger system.
As an expert in the field points out, “We will not buy AI. It will be used to solve problems, and
there will be an expectation that AI will be infused in most things we do.”16

     Selected Definitions—Where possible, an official U.S. government document is cited.
           Automated systems. “A physical system that functions with no (or limited) human operator involvement,
            typically in structured and unchanging environments, and the system’s performance is limited to the specific
            set of actions that it has been designed to accomplish ... typically these are well-defined tasks that have
            predetermined responses according to simple scripted or rule-based prescriptions.”17
           Autonomy. “The condition or quality of being self-governing in order to achieve an assigned task based on
            the system’s own situational awareness (integrated sensing, perceiving, and analyzing), planning, and decision
            making.”18

             Autonomous Weapon System (aka Lethal Autonomous Weapon System, LAWS). “A weapon system
              that, once activated, can select and engage targets without further intervention by a human operator.”19
             Human-Supervised Autonomous Weapon System. “An autonomous weapon system that is designed to
              provide human operators with the ability to intervene and terminate engagements, including in the event
              of a weapon system failure, before unacceptable levels of damage occur.”20
             Semi-Autonomous Weapon System. “A weapon system that, once activated, is intended to only engage
              individual targets or specific target groups that have been selected by a human operator.”21
          Robot. “A powered machine capable of executing a set of actions by direct human control, computer
           control, or a combination of both. At a minimum it is comprised of a platform, software, and a power
           source.”22
     Understanding the relationships between these terms can be challenging, as they may be used interchangeably in
     the literature and definitions often conflict with one another. For example, some studies delineate between
     automated systems and autonomous systems based on the system’s complexity, arguing that automated systems
     are strictly rule-based, while autonomous systems exhibit artificial intelligence. Some, including the Department of
     Defense, categorize autonomous weapon systems based not on the system’s complexity, but rather on the type of
     function being executed without human intervention (e.g., target selection and engagement).23 Still others describe
     AI as a means of automating cognitive tasks, with robotics automating physical tasks. This framework, however,
     may not be sufficient to describe how AI systems function, as such systems do not merely replicate human
     cognitive functions and often produce unanticipated outputs. In addition, a robot may be automated or
     autonomous and may or may not contain an AI algorithm. Figure 1 illustrates these relationships, based on the
     above selected definitions of each term.

Issues for Congress
A number of Members of Congress have called for action on military AI. During the opening
comments to a January 2018 hearing before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on
Emerging Threats, the subcommittee chair called for a “national level effort” to preserve a
technological edge in the field of AI.24 Former Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work argued
in a November 2017 interview that the federal government needs to address AI issues at the
highest levels, further stating that “this is not something the Pentagon can fix by itself.”25
For its part, DOD has published a classified AI strategy and is carrying out multiple tasks directed
by DOD guidance and the FY2019 and FY2020 NDAAs, including
        establishing a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC, pronounced “jake”),
         which now “coordinate[s] the efforts of the Department to develop, mature, and
         transition artificial intelligence technologies into operational use”;26
        publishing a strategic roadmap for AI development and fielding, as well as
         guidance on “appropriate ethical, legal, and other policies for the Department
         governing the development and use of artificial intelligence enabled systems and
         technologies in operational situations”;27
        establishing a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence to conduct
         a comprehensive assessment of militarily relevant AI technologies and provide
         recommendations for strengthening U.S. competitiveness;28 and

These initiatives will present a number of oversight opportunities for Congress.
In addition, Congress may consider the adequacy of current DOD funding levels for AI.
Lieutenant General John Shanahan, the former director of the JAIC, identified funding as a
barrier to future progress.30 Although DOD funding for AI has increased, beginning in 2018—to
include the JAIC’s $1.75 billion six-year budget and the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency’s (DARPA’s) $2 billion multiyear investment in over 20 AI programs—some experts
have argued that additional DOD funding will be required to keep pace with U.S. competitors and
avoid an “innovation deficit” in military technology.31
Critics of increased federal funding contend that significant increases to appropriations may not
be required, as the military should be leveraging research and development (R&D) conducted in
the commercial sector. The 2017 National Security Strategy identifies a need to “establish
strategic partnerships to align private sector R&D resources to priority national security
applications” and to reward government agencies that “take risks and rapidly field emerging
commercial technologies.”32 In addition, the Office of Management and Budget directed DOD in
preparing its FY2020 budget to “seek to rapidly field innovative technologies from the private
sector, where possible, that are easily adaptable to Federal needs, rather than reinventing solutions
in parallel.”33 Some experts in the national security community also argue that it would not be a
responsible use of taxpayer money to duplicate efforts devoted to AI R&D in the commercial
sector when companies take products 90% of the way to a useable military application.34 Others
contend that a number of barriers stand in the way of transitioning AI commercial technology to
DOD, and that reforming aspects of the defense acquisition process may be necessary.35 These
issues are discussed in more detail later in this report.36
One impediment to accurately evaluating funding levels for AI is the lack of a stand-alone AI
Program Element (PE) in DOD funding tables. As a result, AI R&D appropriations are spread
throughout generally titled PEs and incorporated into funding for larger systems with AI

components. For example, in the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act, AI funding is
spread throughout the PEs for the High Performance Computing Modernization Program and
Dominant Information Sciences and Methods, among others.37 On the other hand, a dedicated PE
for AI may lead to a false precision, as it may be challenging to identify exact investments in
enabling technologies like AI.
The lack of an official U.S. government or DOD definition of AI could further complicate such an
assessment. Indeed, DOD’s Office of Inspector General (DODIG) found that each of the military
services uses a different definition of AI, and, in some cases, different individuals within the same
military service were using different definitions of AI. This results in inconsistencies in the types
of projects that are reported to—and overseen by—the JAIC.38 DODIG additionally
recommended that DOD establish “a process to accurately account for AI projects” and “a formal
strategy for collaborating between the military services and DOD components on similar AI
projects.”39
Congress may also consider specific policies for the development and use of military AI
applications. Many experts fear that the pace of AI technology development is moving faster than
the speed of policy implementation. Former Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee
Representative Mac Thornberry has echoed this sentiment, stating, “It seems to me that we’re
always a lot better at developing technologies than we are the policies on how to use them.”40
Congress may assess the need for new policies or modifications to existing laws to account for AI
developments and ensure that AI applications are free from bias.41 Perhaps the most immediate
policy concern among AI analysts is the absence of an independent entity to develop and enforce
AI safety standards and to oversee government-wide AI research.42 Former Secretary of Defense
Ashton B. Carter, for example, has suggested the need for an “AI czar” to coordinate such
efforts.43
Relatedly, Congress may consider debating policy options on the development and fielding of
Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS), which may use AI to select and engage targets.
Since 2014, the United States has participated in international discussions of LAWS at the United
Nations (U.N.) Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). Approximately 30 state
parties have called for a treaty banning “fully autonomous weapon systems” due to ethical

considerations, while others have called for formal regulations or political declarations.44 Some
analysts are concerned that efforts to ban or regulate LAWS could impose strict controls on AI
applications that could be adapted for lethal use, thereby stifling development of other useful
military—or even commercial—technology. During recent testimony to the U.N., one expert
stated, “If we agree to foreswear some technology, we could end up giving up some uses of
automation that could make war more humane. On the other hand a headlong rush into a future of
increasing autonomy with no discussion of where it is taking us, is not in humanity’s interest
either.” He suggested the leading question for considering military AI applications ought to be,
“What role do we want humans to play in wartime decision making?”45
Congress may consider the growth of international competition in the AI market and the danger
of foreign exploitation of U.S. AI technology for military purposes. In particular, the Chinese
government is reported to be aggressively pursuing AI investments in the United States. Amid
growing scrutiny of transactions involving Chinese firms in the semiconductor industry, in
September 2017 President Trump, following the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States (CFIUS), blocked a Chinese firm from acquiring Lattice
Semiconductor, a U.S. company that manufactures chips that are a critical design element for AI
technology.46 In this way, some experts believe that CFIUS may provide a means of protecting
strategically significant technologies like AI.47 Indeed, the Foreign Investment Risk Review
Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) expands CFIUS’s ability to review certain foreign
investments, including those involving “emerging and foundational technologies.” It also
authorized CFIUS to consider “whether a covered transaction involves a country of special
concern that has a demonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical
technology or critical infrastructure that would affect United States leadership in areas related to
national security.”48 Congress may monitor the implementation of FIRRMA and assess whether
additional reforms might be necessary to maintain effective congressional oversight of sensitive
transactions.
In addition, many analysts believe that it may be necessary to reform federal data policies
associated with AI. Large data pools serve as the training sets needed for building many AI
systems, and government data may be particularly important in developing military AI

protection, such as “heavier scrutiny of the potential end use and end user of specific items,” that could potentially
reduce the burden on U.S. corporations. See National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, Interim Report,

applications. However, some analysts have observed that much of this data is classified, access-
controlled, or otherwise protected on privacy grounds. These analysts contend that Congress
should implement a new data policy that balances data protection and privacy with the need to
fuel AI development.49 Similarly, DOD’s October 2020 data strategy seeks to improve the
department’s management of data by making data more visible, accessible, understandable,
linked, trustworthy, interoperable, and secure.50
Closely related, AI development may increase the imperative for strict security standards. As
discussed later in this report, AI algorithms are vulnerable to bias, theft, and manipulation,
particularly if the training data set is not adequately curated or protected. During a February 2018
conference with defense industry CEOs, then-Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan
advocated for higher cybersecurity standards in the commercial sector, stating, “[W]e want the
bar to be so high that it becomes a condition of doing business.”51 Some leading commercial
technology companies have issued similar calls for increased scrutiny, with Microsoft president
Brad Smith arguing that a lack of regulation in this area could lead to “a commercial race to the
bottom, with tech companies forced to choose between social responsibility and market
success.”52
Finally, commercial companies have long cited the potential loss of intellectual property rights as
a key impediment to partnering with DOD. In recognition of this issue, Section 813 of the
FY2016 NDAA established a “government-industry advisory panel” to provide recommendations
on technical data rights and intellectual property reform.53 The panel’s report, released in
November 2018, offers a number of recommendations, including increased training in intellectual
property rights for acquisitions professionals and a pilot program for intellectual property
valuation in the procurement process.54


AI Applications for Defense
DOD is considering a number of diverse applications for AI. Currently, AI R&D is being left to
the discretion of research organizations in the individual services, as well as to DARPA and the
Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency (IARPA). However, DOD components are
required to coordinate with the JAIC regarding any planned AI initiatives costing more than $15
million annually.55 In addition, the JAIC has been tasked with overseeing the National Mission

Initiatives (NMI), projects that leverage AI to address pressing operational challenges.56 The
JAIC began work on its first two NMIs—predictive maintenance and humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief—in 2019. According to former JAIC acting director Nand Mulchandani, the JAIC
then shifted its focus to joint warfighting and, in May 2020, awarded an $800 million contract to
Booz Allen Hamilton to “bring AI to the battlefield.”57 Current JAIC director Lt. Gen. Michael
Groen has stated that the JAIC is now focused on further developing databases and software tools
for use in AI projects through the department.58 AI is being incorporated into a number of other
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance applications, as well as in logistics, cyberspace
operations, information operations, command and control, semiautonomous and autonomous
vehicles, and lethal autonomous weapon systems.

Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
AI is expected to be particularly useful in intelligence due to the large data sets available for
analysis.59 For example, Project Maven is intended to incorporate computer vision and AI
algorithms into intelligence collection cells that would comb through footage from uninhabited
aerial vehicles and automatically identify hostile activity for targeting. In this capacity, AI is
intended to automate the work of human analysts who currently spend hours sifting through drone
footage for actionable information, potentially freeing analysts to make more efficient and timely
decisions based on the data.60
The intelligence community also has a number of publicly acknowledged AI research projects in
progress. The Central Intelligence Agency alone has around 140 projects in development that
leverage AI in some capacity to accomplish tasks such as image recognition and predictive
analytics.61 IARPA is sponsoring several AI research projects intended to produce other analytic
tools within the next four to five years. Some examples include developing algorithms for
multilingual speech recognition and translation in noisy environments, geo-locating images
without the associated metadata, fusing 2-D images to create 3-D models, and building tools to
infer a building’s function based on pattern-of-life analysis.62

Logistics
AI may have future utility in the field of military logistics. The Air Force, for example, is
beginning to use AI for predictive aircraft maintenance. Instead of making repairs when an
aircraft breaks or in accordance with standardized fleet-wide maintenance schedules, the Air
Force is testing an AI-enabled approach that tailors maintenance schedules to the needs of
individual aircraft. This approach, currently used by the F-35’s Autonomic Logistics Information
System, extracts real-time sensor data embedded in the aircraft’s engines and other onboard
systems and feeds the data into a predictive algorithm to determine when technicians need to
inspect the aircraft or replace parts.63
Similarly, the Army’s Logistics Support Activity (LOGSA) has contracted IBM’s Watson (the
same AI software that defeated two Jeopardy champions) to develop tailored maintenance
schedules for the Stryker fleet based on information pulled from the 17 sensors installed on each
vehicle. In September 2017, LOGSA began a second project that will use Watson to analyze
shipping flows for repair parts distribution, attempting to determine the most time- and cost-
efficient means to deliver supplies. This task is currently done by human analysts, who have
saved the Army around $100 million a year by analyzing just 10% of shipping requests; with
Watson, the Army will have the ability to analyze 100% of shipping requests, potentially
generating even greater cost savings in a shorter period of time.64

Cyberspace Operations
AI is likely to be a key technology in advancing military cyber operations. In his 2016 testimony
before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Commander of U.S. Cyber Command Admiral
Michael Rogers stated that relying on human intelligence alone in cyberspace is “a losing
strategy.”65 He later clarified this point, stating, “If you can’t get some level of AI or machine
learning with the volume of activity you’re trying to understand when you’re defending networks
... you are always behind the power curve.”66 Conventional cybersecurity tools look for historical
matches to known malicious code, so hackers only have to modify small portions of that code to
circumvent the defense. AI-enabled tools, on the other hand, can be trained to detect anomalies in
broader patterns of network activity, thus presenting a more comprehensive and dynamic barrier
to attack.67
DARPA’s 2016 Cyber Grand Challenge demonstrated the potential power of AI-enabled cyber
tools. The competition challenged participants to develop AI algorithms that could autonomously

demonstrated not only the potential speed of AI-enabled cyber tools but also the potential ability
of a singular algorithm to play offense and defense simultaneously. These capabilities could
provide a distinct advantage in future cyber operations.

Information Operations and “Deep Fakes”69
AI is enabling increasingly realistic photo, audio, and video forgeries, or “deep fakes,” that
adversaries could deploy as part of their information operations. Indeed, deep fake technology
could be used against the United States and U.S. allies to generate false news reports, influence
public discourse, erode public trust, and attempt to blackmail diplomats.70 Although most
previous deep fakes have been detectable by experts, the sophistication of the technology is
progressing to the point that it may soon be capable of fooling forensic analysis tools.71
In order to combat deep fake technologies, DARPA has launched the Media Forensics (MediFor)
project, which seeks to “automatically detect manipulations, provide detailed information about
how these manipulations were performed, and reason about the overall integrity of visual
media.”72 MediFor has developed some initial tools for identifying AI-produced forgeries, but as
one analyst has noted, “a key problem … is that machine-learning systems can be trained to
outmaneuver forensics tools.”73 For this reason, DARPA plans to host follow-on contests to
ensure that forensic tools keep pace with deep fake technologies.74 It has also launched SemaFor,
which seeks to develop algorithms that will automatically detect, attribute, and characterize (i.e.,
identify as either benign or malicious) various types of deep fakes.
Artificial intelligence could also be used to create full “digital patterns-of-life,” in which an
individual’s digital “footprint” is “merged and matched with purchase histories, credit reports,
professional resumes, and subscriptions” to create a comprehensive behavioral profile of
servicemembers, suspected intelligence officers, government officials, or private citizens.75 As in
the case of deep fakes, this information could, in turn, be used for targeted influence operations or
blackmail.

Command and Control
The U.S. military is seeking to exploit AI’s analytic potential in the area of command and control.
DOD is developing various systems in support of its concept of Joint All Domain Command and

Control (JADC2), which aims to centralize planning and execution of air-, space-, cyberspace-,
sea-, and land-based operations.76 In the immediate future, AI may be used to fuse data from
sensors in all of these domains to create a single source of information, also known as a “common
operating picture,” for decisionmakers.77 Currently, information available to decisionmakers
comes in diverse formats from multiple platforms, often with redundancies or unresolved
discrepancies. An AI-enabled common operating picture would theoretically combine this
information into one display, providing a comprehensive picture of friendly and enemy forces,
and automatically resolving variances from input data. Such a system could eventually enable
“any sensor to provide data to any shooter from any service, ally, or partner … to achieve effects
against any target.”78 The services have a number of related programs that are designed to
demonstrate the capabilities needed to execute JADC2, including the Army’s Project
Convergence and the Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System.79 Similarly, DARPA’s
Mosaic Warfare program seeks to leverage AI to network systems and sensors, prioritize
incoming sensor data, and autonomously determine the optimal composition of forces. 80
Future AI systems may be used to identify communications links cut by an adversary and find
alternative means of distributing information. As the complexity of AI systems matures, AI
algorithms may also be capable of providing commanders with a menu of viable courses of action
based on real-time analysis of the battle-space, potentially improving the quality and speed of
wartime decisionmaking.81

Semiautonomous and Autonomous Vehicles
All U.S. military services are working to incorporate AI into semiautonomous and autonomous
vehicles, including fighter aircraft, drones, ground vehicles, and naval vessels. AI applications in
this field are similar to those for commercial semiautonomous vehicles, which use AI
technologies to perceive the environment, recognize obstacles, fuse sensor data, plan navigation,
and even communicate with other vehicles.82
The Air Force Research Lab completed phase-two tests of its Loyal Wingman program, which
pairs an older-generation, uninhabited fighter jet (in this case, an F-16) with an inhabited F-35 or
F-22. During this event, the uninhabited F-16 test platform autonomously reacted to events that
were not preprogrammed, such as weather and unforeseen obstacles.83 As the program progresses,

AI may enable the “loyal wingman” to accomplish tasks for its inhabited flight lead, such as
jamming electronic threats or carrying extra weapons.84
The Army and the Marine Corps tested prototypes of similar vehicles that follow soldiers or
vehicles around the battlefield to accomplish independent tasks.85 For example, the Marine Corps’
Multi-Utility Tactical Transport (MUTT) is a remote-controlled, ATV-sized vehicle capable of
carrying hundreds of pounds of extra equipment. Although the system is not autonomous in its
current configuration, the Marine Corps intends for follow-on systems to have greater
independence.86 Likewise, the Army plans to field a number of Robotic Combat Vehicles (RCVs)
with different types of autonomous functionality, including navigation, surveillance, and IED
removal. These systems are to be deployed as “wingmen” for the Optionally Manned Fighting
Vehicle.87
DARPA completed testing of the Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel
prototype, or “Sea Hunter,” in early 2018 before transitioning program development to the
Navy.88 Sea Hunter has since been integrated into Surface Development Squadron 1, which has
been tasked with overseeing “fleet familiarization, training and tactics development of [unmanned
surface vessels].” If Sea Hunter enters into service, it would provide the Navy with the ability to
autonomously navigate the open seas, swap out modular payloads, and coordinate missions with
other unmanned vessels—all while providing continuous submarine-hunting coverage for months
at a time.89 Some analysts estimate that Sea Hunter would cost around $20,000 a day to operate,
in contrast to around $700,000 for a traditionally inhabited destroyer.90 In addition, the Navy has
launched the Rapid Autonomy Integration Lab (RAIL) “to develop, test, certify and deploy new
and updated autonomous capabilities.”91
DOD is testing other AI-fueled capabilities to enable cooperative behavior, or swarming.
Swarming is a unique subset of autonomous vehicle development, with concepts ranging from
large formations of low-cost vehicles designed to overwhelm defensive systems to small
squadrons of vehicles that collaborate to provide electronic attack, fire support, and localized
navigation and communication nets for ground-troop formations.92 A number of different swarm

completed a test of an AI-enabled swarm of five unmanned boats that cooperatively patrolled a 4-

experiment may lead to AI technology adapted for defending harbors, hunting submarines, or

underwater drones, and the Strategic Capabilities Office has successfully tested a swarm of 103

Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS)
Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS) are a special class of weapon systems that use
sensor suites and computer algorithms to independently identify a target and employ an onboard
weapon system to engage and destroy the target without manual human control of the system.
Although these systems are not yet in widespread development, they could enable military
operations in communications-degraded or -denied environments in which traditional systems
may not be able to operate. The U.S. military does not currently have LAWS in its inventory,
although there are no legal prohibitions on the development of LAWS.
DOD Directive 3000.09, “Autonomy in Weapon Systems,” outlines department policies for
semiautonomous and autonomous weapon systems.96 The directive requires that all systems,
regardless of classification, be designed to “allow commanders and operators to exercise
appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force” and to successfully complete the
department’s weapons review process.97 Any changes to the system’s operating state require that
the system go through the weapons review process again to ensure that it has retained the ability
to operate as intended. Autonomous weapons and a limited type of semiautonomous weapons
must additionally be approved before both development and fielding by the Under Secretary of
Defense for Policy, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and either the Under Secretary of
Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment or the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and

Engineering. Human-supervised autonomous weapons used for point defense of manned
installations or platforms—but that do not target humans—and autonomous weapons that “apply
non-lethal, non-kinetic force, such as some forms of electronic attack, against materiel targets”
are exempted from this senior-level review.98
Despite this policy, some senior military and defense leaders have expressed concerns about the
prospect of fielding LAWS. For example, in 2017 testimony before the Senate Armed Services
Committee, then-Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul Selva stated, “I do not
think it is reasonable for us to put robots in charge of whether or not we take a human life.”99
Regardless, General Selva explained that the military will be compelled to address the
development of this class of technology in order to find its vulnerabilities, given the fact that
potential U.S. adversaries are pursuing LAWS.100 Indeed, as former Secretary of Defense Mark
Esper has noted, “Chinese weapons manufacturers are selling drones advertised as capable of full
autonomy, including the ability to conduct lethal targeted strikes.”101


Military AI Integration Challenges
From the Cold War era until recently, most major defense-related technologies, including nuclear
technology, the Global Positioning System (GPS), and the internet, were first developed by
government-directed programs before later spreading to the commercial sector.102 Indeed,
DARPA’s Strategic Computing Initiative invested over $1 billion between 1983 and 1993 to
develop the field of artificial intelligence for military applications, but the initiative was
ultimately cancelled due to slower-than-anticipated progress.103 Today, commercial companies—
sometimes building on past government-funded research—are leading AI development, with
DOD later adapting their tools for military applications.104 Noting this dynamic, one AI expert
commented, “It is unusual to have a technology that is so strategically important being developed
commercially by a relatively small number of companies.”105 In addition to the shift in funding

science and engineering community. The effort started in WWII with the creation of large research and development
organizations dedicated to creating war-winning technology. The government continued to invest large amounts of
money into research and development during the Cold War, as technological superiority was perceived as a key
measure of national strength. McNeill states, “The ultimate test of American society in its competition with the Soviets
boiled down to finding out which contestant could develop superior skills in every field of human endeavor.... This
would guarantee prosperity at home and security abroad.” This effort had lingering effects that have persisted to some
extent in the wake of the Cold War.

sources, a number of challenges related to technology, process, personnel, and culture continue to
impede the adoption of AI for military purposes.

Technology
A wide variance exists in the ease of adaptability of commercial AI technology for military
purposes. In some cases, the transition is relatively seamless. For example, the aforementioned
aircraft maintenance algorithms, many of which were initially developed by the commercial
sector, will likely require only minor data adjustments to account for differences between aircraft
types. In other circumstances, significant adjustments are required due to the differences between
the structured civilian environments for which the technology was initially developed and more
complex combat environments. For example, commercial semiautonomous vehicles have largely
been developed in and for data-rich environments with reliable GPS positions, comprehensive
terrain mapping, and up-to-date information on traffic and weather conditions obtained from
other networked vehicles.106 In contrast, the military variant of such a vehicle would need to be
able to operate in locations where map data are comparatively poor and in which GPS positioning
may be inoperable due to adversary jamming. Moreover, semiautonomous or autonomous
military ground vehicles would likely need the ability to navigate off-road in rough terrain—a
capability not inherent in most commercial vehicles.107

Process
Standing DOD processes—including those related to standards of safety and performance,
acquisitions, and intellectual property and data rights—present another challenge to the
integration of military AI. Often, civilian and military standards of safety and performance are
either not aligned or are not easily transferable. A failure rate deemed acceptable for a civilian AI
application may be well outside of tolerances in a combat environment—or vice versa. In
addition, a recent research study concluded that unpredictable AI failure modes will be
exacerbated in complex environments, such as those found in combat.108 Collectively, these
factors may create another barrier for the smooth transfer of commercially developed AI
technology to DOD.
DOD may need to continue to adjust its acquisitions process to account for rapidly evolving
technologies such as AI.109 A 2017 internal study of the process found that it takes an average of
91 months to move from the initial Analysis of Alternatives, defining the requirements for a
system, to an Initial Operational Capability.110 In contrast, commercial companies typically
execute an iterative development process for software systems like AI, delivering a product in six
to nine months.111 These findings prompted DOD to issue an interim software acquisition policy

intended to “[simplify] the acquisition model to enable continuous integration and delivery of
software capability on timelines relevant to the Warfighter/end user.”112
Furthermore, the commercial companies that are often at the forefront of AI innovation may be
reluctant to partner with DOD due to the complexity of the defense acquisition process. A
Government Accountability Office (GAO) study of this issue found that, of 12 U.S. commercial
companies who choose not to do business with DOD, all 12 cited the complexity of the defense
acquisition process as a rationale for their decision.113 DOD has created a number of avenues for
“rapid-acquisitions”—including the Strategic Capabilities Office, the Defense Innovation Unit,
and Project Maven—that are intended streamline cumbersome processes and accelerate the
acquisitions timeline.114 Project Maven, for example, was established in April 2017; by
December, the team was fielding a commercially acquired prototype AI system in combat.115
Although some analysts argue that these are promising developments, critics point out that the
department must replicate the results achieved by Project Maven at scale and implement more
comprehensive acquisitions reform.116
Commercial technology companies are also often reluctant to partner with DOD due to concerns
about intellectual property and data rights.117 As an official interviewed for a 2017 GAO report on
broader challenges in military acquisitions noted, intellectual property is the “life blood” of
commercial technology companies, yet “DOD is putting increased pressure on companies to grant
unlimited technical data and software rights or government purpose rights rather than limited or
restricted rights.”118 In an effort to manage these concerns, DOD released an instruction that
“establishes policy, assigns responsibilities, and prescribes procedures for the acquisition,
licensing, and management of IP.”119 The instruction additionally establishes a DOD IP Cadre to
advise and assist the acquisition workforce on matters related to IP and calls for the development
of an IP strategy to “identify and manage the full spectrum of IP and related matters” for each
acquisition program.120

Personnel
Some reports indicate that DOD and the defense industry also face challenges when it comes to
recruiting and retaining personnel with expertise in AI due to research funding and salaries that
significantly lag behind those of commercial companies.121 Other reports suggest that such
challenges stem from quality-of-life factors, as well as from a belief among many technology
workers that “they can achieve large-scale change faster and better outside the government than
within it.”122 This sentiment echoes the findings of the National Security Commission on
Artificial Intelligence, which notes that “AI experts would be willing to serve in government if
officials could create a more compelling sense of purpose and a technical environment within
government that would maximize their talents.”123 Regardless, observers note that if DOD and
defense industry are unable to recruit and retain the appropriate experts, military AI applications
could be delayed, “deficient, or lacking in appropriate safeguards and testing.”124
To address these challenges, the Obama Administration launched the Defense Digital Service in
2015 as a means of recruiting private sector technology workers to serve in DOD for one to two
year assignments—a “tour of duty for nerds,” according to former director Chris Lynch.125
Similarly, former Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work has proposed an “AI Training Corps,”
in which DOD “would pay for advanced technical education in exchange for two days a month of
training with government systems and two weeks a year for major exercises.” Participants in the
program could additionally be called to government service in the event of a national
emergency.126 Other analysts have recommended the establishment of new military training and
occupational specialties to cultivate AI talent, as well as the creation of government fellowships
and accelerated promotion tracks to reward the most talented technology workers.127

Culture
An apparent cultural divide between DOD and commercial technology companies may also
present challenges for AI adoption. A recent survey of leadership in several top Silicon Valley
companies found that nearly 80% of participants rated the commercial technology community’s
relationship with DOD as poor or very poor.128 This was due to a number of factors, including

process challenges, perceptions of mutual distrust, and differences between DOD and commercial
incentive structures.129
Moreover, some companies are refusing to work with DOD due to ethical concerns over the
government’s use of AI in surveillance or weapon systems. Notably, Google canceled existing
government contracts for two robotics companies it acquired—Boston Dynamics and Schaft—
and prohibited future government work for DeepMind, a Google-acquired AI software startup.130
In May 2018, Google employees successfully lobbied the company to withdraw from Project
Maven and refrain from further collaboration with DOD.131 Other companies, however, have
pledged to continue supporting DOD contracts, with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos noting that “if big
tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is
going to be in trouble.”132
Cultural factors within the defense establishment itself may also impede AI integration. The
integration of AI into existing systems alters standardized procedures and upends well-defined
personnel roles. Members of Project Maven have reported a resistance to AI integration because
integration can be disruptive without always providing an immediately recognizable benefit.133
Deputy Director for CIA technology development Dawn Meyerriecks has also expressed concern
about the willingness of senior leaders to accept AI-generated analysis, arguing that the defense
establishment’s risk-averse culture may pose greater challenges to future competitiveness than the
pace of adversary technology development.134
Finally, some analysts are concerned that DOD will not capitalize on AI’s potential to produce
game-changing warfighting benefits and will instead simply use AI to incrementally improve
existing processes or reinforce current operational concepts. Furthermore, the services may reject
certain AI applications altogether if the technology threatens service-favored hardware or
missions.135 Members of Congress may explore the complex interaction of these factors as DOD
moves beyond the initial stages of AI adoption.


International Competitors
As military applications for AI grow in scale and complexity, many in Congress and the defense
community are becoming increasingly concerned about international competition. In his opening
comments at “The Dawn of AI” hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science, and
Competitiveness, Senator Ted Cruz stated, “Ceding leadership in developing artificial intelligence
to China, Russia, and other foreign governments will not only place the United States at a
technological disadvantage, but it could have grave implications for national security.”136

Since at least 2016, AI has been consistently identified as an “emerging and disruptive
technology” at the Senate Select Intelligence Committee’s annual hearing on the “Worldwide
Threat Assessment.”137 In his written testimony for the 2017 hearing, Director of National
Intelligence Daniel Coates asserted, “The implications of our adversaries’ abilities to use AI are
potentially profound and broad. They include an increased vulnerability to cyberattack, difficulty
in ascertaining attribution, facilitation of advances in foreign weapon and intelligence systems,
the risk of accidents and related liability issues, and unemployment.”138 Consequently, it may be
important for Congress to understand the state of rival AI development—particularly because
U.S. competitors may have fewer moral, legal, or ethical qualms about developing military AI
applications.139

China
China is by far the United States’ closest competitor in the international AI market.140 China’s
2017 “Next Generation AI Development Plan” describes AI as a “strategic technology” that has
become a “focus of international competition.”141 According to the document, China will seek to
develop a core AI industry worth over 150 billion RMB142—or approximately $21.7 billion—by
2020 and will “firmly seize the strategic initiative” and reach “world leading levels” of AI
investment by 2030.
Recent Chinese achievements in the field demonstrate China’s potential to realize its goals for AI
development. In 2015, China’s leading AI company, Baidu, created AI software capable of
surpassing human levels of language recognition, almost a year in advance of Microsoft, the
nearest U.S. competitor.143 In 2016 and 2017, Chinese teams won the top prize at the Large Scale
Visual Recognition Challenge, an international competition for computer vision systems.144 Many
of these systems are now being integrated into China’s domestic surveillance network and social
credit system, which aims to monitor and, based on social behavior, “grade” every Chinese
citizen by 2021.145

China is researching various types of air, land, sea, and undersea autonomous vehicles. In the
spring of 2017, a civilian Chinese university with ties to the military demonstrated an AI-enabled
swarm of 1,000 uninhabited aerial vehicles at an airshow. A media report released after the fact
showed a computer simulation of a similar swarm formation finding and destroying a missile
launcher.146 Open-source publications indicate that the Chinese are also developing a suite of AI
tools for cyber operations.147
Chinese development of military AI is influenced in large part by China’s observation of U.S.
plans for defense innovation and fears of a widening “generational gap” in comparison to the U.S.
military.148 Similar to U.S. military concepts, the Chinese aim to use AI for exploiting large troves
of intelligence, generating a common operating picture, and accelerating battlefield
decisionmaking.149 The close parallels between U.S. and Chinese AI development have some
DOD leaders concerned about the prospects for retaining conventional U.S. military superiority
as envisioned in current defense innovation guidance.150
Analysts do, however, point to a number of differences that may influence the success of military
AI adoption in China. Significantly, unlike the United States, China has not been involved in
active combat for several decades. While on the surface this may seem like a weakness, some
argue that it may be an advantage, enabling the Chinese to develop more innovative concepts of
operation. On the other hand, Chinese military culture, which is dominated by centralized
command authority and mistrust of subordinates, may prove resistant to the adoption of
autonomous systems or the integration of AI-generated decisionmaking tools.151
China’s management of its AI ecosystem stands in stark contrast to that of the United States.152 In
general, few boundaries exist between Chinese commercial companies, university research
laboratories, the military, and the central government. As a result, the Chinese government has a
direct means of guiding AI development priorities and accessing technology that was ostensibly
developed for civilian purposes. To further strengthen these ties, the Chinese government created
a Military-Civil Fusion Development Commission in 2017, which is intended to speed the
transfer of AI technology from commercial companies and research institutions to the military.153
In addition, the Chinese government is leveraging both lower barriers to data collection and lower

costs to data labeling to create the large databases on which AI systems train.154 According to one
estimate, China is on track to possess 30% of the world’s share of data by 2030.155
China’s centrally directed effort is fueling speculation in the U.S. AI market, where China is
investing in companies working on militarily relevant AI applications—potentially granting it
lawful access to U.S. technology and intellectual property.156 Figure 2 depicts Chinese venture
capital investment in U.S. AI companies between 2010 and 2017, totaling an estimated $1.3
billion. The CFIUS reforms introduced in FIRRMA are intended to provide increased oversight of
such investments to ensure that they do not threaten national security or grant U.S. competitors
undue access to critical technologies.157 Indeed, early analysis suggests a correlation between
CFIUS reforms and a reduction in Chinese investment in U.S. AI companies.158

Even with these reforms, however, China may likely gain access to U.S. commercial
developments in AI given its extensive history of industrial espionage and cyber theft. China has
reportedly stolen design plans in the past for a number of advanced military technologies and
continues to do so despite the 2015 U.S.-China Cyber Agreement, in which both sides agreed that

“neither country’s government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of
intellectual property.”159 Furthermore, as Assistant Attorney General John Demers has testified to
Congress, “from 2011-2018, more than 90 percent of the [Justice] Department’s cases alleging
economic espionage by or to benefit a state involve China, and more than two-thirds of the
Department’s theft of trade secrets cases have had a nexus to China.”160
While most analysts view China’s unified, whole-of-government effort to develop AI as having a
distinct advantage over the United States’ AI efforts, many contend that it does have
shortcomings. For example, some analysts characterize the Chinese government’s funding
management as inefficient. They point out that the system is often corrupt, with favored research
institutions receiving a disproportionate share of government funding, and that the government
has a potential to overinvest in projects that produce surpluses that exceed market demand.161
In addition, China faces challenges in recruiting and retaining AI engineers and researchers. Over
half of the data scientists in the United States have been working in the field for over 10 years,
while roughly the same proportion of data scientists in China have less than 5 years of
experience. Furthermore, fewer than 30 Chinese universities produce AI-focused experts and
research products.162 Although China surpassed the United States in the quantity of research
papers produced from 2011 to 2015, the quality of its published papers, as judged by peer
citations, ranked 34th globally.163 China is, however, making efforts to address these deficiencies,
with a particular focus on the development of military AI applications. Indeed, the Beijing
Institute of Technology—one of China’s premier institutes for weapons research—recently
established the first educational program in military AI in the world.164
Some experts believe that China’s intent to be the first to develop military AI applications may
result in comparatively less safe applications, as China will likely be more risk-acceptant
throughout the development process. These experts stated that it would be unethical for the U.S.
military to sacrifice safety standards for the sake of external time pressures, but that the United
States’ more conservative approach to AI development may result in more capable systems in the
long run.165

Russia
Like China, Russia is actively pursuing military AI applications. At present, Russian AI
development lags significantly behind that of the United States and China, with no Russian AI
startup ranking in the top 100.166 However, Russia is initiating plans to close the gap. As part of
this effort, Russia has released a national strategy for artificial intelligence, which outlines 5- and
10-year benchmarks for improving the country’s AI expertise, educational programs, datasets,
infrastructure, and legal regulatory system.167 Russia will also continue to pursue its 2008 defense
modernization agenda, with the aim of robotizing 30% of its military equipment by 2025.168
Russia is establishing a number of organizations devoted to the development of military AI. In
March 2018, the Russian government released a 10-point AI agenda, which calls for the
establishment of an AI and Big Data consortium, a Fund for Analytical Algorithms and Programs,
a state-backed AI training and education program, a dedicated AI lab, and a National Center for
Artificial Intelligence, among other initiatives.169 In addition, Russia recently created a defense
research organization, roughly equivalent to DARPA, dedicated to autonomy and robotics called
the Foundation for Advanced Studies, and initiated an annual conference on “Robotization of the
Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.”170 Some analysts have noted that this recent
proliferation of research institutions devoted to AI may, however, result in overlapping
responsibilities and bureaucratic inertia, hindering AI development rather than accelerating it.171
The Russian military has been researching a number of AI applications, with a heavy emphasis on
semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. In an official statement on November 1, 2017, Viktor
Bondarev, chairman of the Federation Council’s Defense and Security Committee, stated that
“artificial intelligence will be able to replace a soldier on the battlefield and a pilot in an aircraft
cockpit” and later noted that “the day is nearing when vehicles will get artificial intelligence.”172
Bondarev made these remarks in close proximity to the successful test of Nerehta, an uninhabited
Russian ground vehicle that reportedly “outperformed existing [inhabited] combat vehicles.”
Russia plans to use Nerehta as a research and development platform for AI and may one day
deploy the system in combat, intelligence gathering, or logistics roles.173 Russia has also
reportedly built a combat module for uninhabited ground vehicles that is capable of autonomous

target identification—and, potentially, target engagement—and plans to develop a suite of AI-
enabled autonomous systems.174
In addition, the Russian military plans to incorporate AI into uninhabited aerial, naval, and
undersea vehicles and is currently developing swarming capabilities.175 It is also exploring
innovative uses of AI for remoting sensing and electronic warfare, including adaptive frequency
hopping, waveforms, and countermeasures.176 Finally, Russia has made extensive use of AI
technologies for domestic propaganda and surveillance, as well as for information operations
directed against the United States and U.S. allies, and can be expected to continue to do so in the
future.177
Despite its aspirations, analysts argue that it may be difficult for Russia to make significant
progress in AI development given fluctuations in Russian military spending. In 2017, Russian
military spending dropped by 20% in constant dollars, with subsequent cuts in 2018.178 Spending
then rose in 2019, but is expected to drop in constant dollars from 2020 through 2022.179 In
addition, many analysts note that Russian academics have produced few research papers on AI
and that the Russian technology industry has yet to produce AI applications that are on par with
those produced by the United States and China.180 Others analysts counter that such factors may
be irrelevant, arguing that while Russia has never been a leader in internet technology, it has still
managed to become a notably disruptive force in cyberspace.181 Russia may also be able to draw
upon its growing technological cooperation with China.182

International Institutions
A number of international institutions have examined issues surrounding AI, including the Group
of Seven (G7), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which has developed principles for the
development of trustworthy AI.183 The U.N. CCW, however, has made the most concerted effort
to consider certain military applications of AI, with a particular focus on LAWS. In general, the
CCW is charged with “banning or restricting the use of specific types of weapons that are
considered to cause unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to combatants or to affect civilian
populations” and has previously debated weapons such as mines, cluster munitions, and blinding
lasers.184 The CCW began discussions on LAWS in 2014 with informal annual “Meetings of
Experts.”185 In parallel, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) held similar
gatherings of interdisciplinary experts on LAWS that produced reports for the CCW on technical,
legal, moral, and humanitarian issues.186 During the CCW’s April 2016 meeting, state parties
agreed to establish a formal Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), with an official mandate to
“assess questions related to emerging technologies in the area of LAWS.”187 Although the GGE
has now convened five times, it has not produced an official definition of LAWS or issued official
guidance for their development or use. As a result, one observer cautioned that the international
community is in danger of “the pace of diplomacy falling behind the speed of technological
advancement.”188 The U.S. government, however, maintains that existing international
humanitarian law is sufficient to govern the development or use of LAWS.189


AI Opportunities and Challenges
AI poses a number of unique opportunities and challenges within a national security context.
However, its ultimate impact will likely be determined by the extent to which developers, with
the assistance of policymakers, are able to maximize its strengths while identifying options to
limit its vulnerabilities.

Autonomy
Many autonomous systems incorporate AI in some form. Such systems were a central focus of the
Obama Administration’s “Third Offset Strategy,” a framework for preserving the U.S. military’s
technological edge against global competitors.190 Depending on the task, autonomous systems are
capable of augmenting or replacing humans, freeing them up for more complex and cognitively
demanding work. In general, experts assert that the military stands to gain significant benefits
from autonomous systems by replacing humans in tasks that are “dull, dangerous, or dirty.”191
Specific examples of autonomy in military systems include systems that conduct long-duration
intelligence collection and analysis, clean up environments contaminated by chemical weapons,
or sweep routes for improvised explosive devices.192 In these roles, autonomous systems may
reduce risk to warfighters and cut costs, providing a range of value to DOD missions, as
illustrated in Figure 3.193 Some analysts argue these advantages create a “tactical and strategic
necessity” as well as a “moral obligation” to develop autonomous systems.194

Speed and Endurance
AI introduces a unique means of operating in combat at the extremes of the time scale. It provides
systems with an ability to react at gigahertz speed, which in turn holds the potential to
dramatically accelerate the overall pace of combat.195 As discussed below, some analysts contend
that a drastic increase in the pace of combat could be destabilizing—particularly if it exceeds
human ability to understand and control events—and could increase a system’s destructive
potential in the event of a loss of system control.196 Despite this risk, some argue that speed will
confer a definitive warfighting advantage, in turn creating pressures for widespread adoption of
military AI applications.197 In addition, AI systems may provide benefits in long-duration tasks
that exceed human endurance. For example, AI systems may enable intelligence gathering across
large areas over long periods of time, as well as the ability to autonomously detect anomalies and
categorize behavior.198

Scaling
AI has the potential to provide a force-multiplying effect by enhancing human capabilities and
infusing less expensive military systems with increased capability. For example, although an
individual low-cost drone may be powerless against a high-tech system like the F-35 stealth
fighter, a swarm of such drones could potentially overwhelm high-tech systems, generating
significant cost-savings and potentially rendering some current platforms obsolete.199 AI systems
could also increase the productivity of individual servicemembers as the systems take over
routine tasks or enable tactics like swarming that require minimal human involvement.200
Finally, some analysts caution that the proliferation of AI systems may decouple military power
from population size and economic strength. This decoupling may enable smaller countries and
nonstate actors to have a disproportionately large impact on the battlefield if they are able to
capitalize on the scaling effects of AI.201

Information Superiority
AI may offer a means to cope with an exponential increase in the amount of data available for
analysis. According to one DOD source, the military operates over 11,000 drones, with each one
recording “more than three NFL seasons worth” of high-definition footage each day.202 However,
the department does not have sufficient people or an adequate system to comb through the data in
order to derive actionable intelligence analysis.

This issue will likely be exacerbated in the future as data continue to accumulate. According to
one study, in 2020, every human on the planet will generate 1.7 megabytes of information every
second, growing the global pool of data to almost 44.0 zettabytes, up from 4.4 zettabytes in
2015.203 AI-powered intelligence systems may provide the ability to integrate and sort through
large troves of data from different sources and geographic locations to identify patterns and
highlight useful information, significantly improving intelligence analysis.204 In addition, AI
algorithms may generate their own data to feed further analysis, accomplishing tasks like
converting unstructured information from polls, financial data, and election results into written
reports. AI tools of this type thus hold the potential to bestow a warfighting advantage by
improving the quality of information available to decisionmakers.205

Predictability
AI algorithms often produce unpredictable and unconventional results. In March 2016, the AI
company DeepMind created a game-playing algorithm called AlphaGo, which defeated a world-
champion Go player, Lee Sedol, four games to one. After the match, Sedol commented that
AlphaGo made surprising and innovative moves, and other expert Go players subsequently stated
that AlphaGo overturned accumulated wisdom on game play.206 AI’s capacity to produce
similarly unconventional results in a military context may provide an advantage in combat,
particularly if those results surprise an adversary.
However, AI systems can fail in unexpected ways, with some analysts characterizing their
behavior as “brittle and inflexible.”207 Dr. Arati Prabhakar, the former DARPA Director,
commented, “When we look at what’s happening with AI, we see something that is very
powerful, but we also see a technology that is still quite fundamentally limited ... the problem is
that when it’s wrong, it’s wrong in ways that no human would ever be wrong.”208
AI-based image recognition algorithms surpassed human performance in 2010, most recently
achieving an error rate of 2.5% in contrast to the average human error rate of 5%; however, some
commonly cited experiments with these systems demonstrate their capacity for failure.209 As
illustrated in Figure 4, researchers combined a picture that an AI system correctly identified as a
panda with random distortion that the computer labeled “nematode.” The difference in the
combined image is imperceptible to human eyes, but resulted in the AI system labeling the image
as a gibbon with 99.3% confidence.

the algorithm’s inability to understand
context. Some experts warn that AI may be
operating with different assumptions about
the environment than human operators, who
would have little awareness of when the
system is outside the boundaries of its
original design.210
Similarly, AI systems may be subject to
algorithmic bias as a result of their training
data. For example, researchers have
repeatedly discovered instances of racial bias
in AI facial recognition programs due to the          Source: John Launchbury, “A DARPA Perspective on
lack of diversity in the images on which the          Artificial Intelligence,” https://www.darpa.mil/
systems were trained, while some natural              attachments/AIFull.pdf, p. 23.
language processing programs have
developed gender bias.211 This could hold significant implications for AI applications in a military
context, particularly if such biases remain undetected and are incorporated into systems with
lethal effects.
“Domain adaptability,” or the ability of AI systems to adjust between two disparate environments,
may also present challenges for militaries. For example, one AI system developed to recognize
and understand online text was trained primarily on formal language documents like Wikipedia
articles. The system was later unable to interpret more informal language in Twitter posts.212
Domain adaptability failures could occur when systems developed in a civilian environment are
transferred to a combat environment.213

AI system failures may create a significant risk if the systems are deployed at scale. One analyst
noted that although humans are not immune from errors, their mistakes are typically made on an
individual basis, and they tend to be different every time. However, AI systems have the potential
to fail simultaneously and in the same way, potentially producing large-scale or destructive
effects.214 Other unanticipated results may arise when U.S. AI systems interact with adversary AI
systems trained on different data sets with different design parameters and cultural biases.215
Analysts warn that if militaries rush to field the technology prior to gaining a comprehensive
understanding of potential hazards, they may incur a “technical debt,” a term that refers to the
effect of fielding AI systems that have minimal risk individually but compounding collective risk
due to interactions between systems.216 This risk could be further exacerbated in the event of an
AI arms race.217

Explainability
Further complicating issues of predictability, the types of AI algorithms that have the highest
performance are currently unable to explain their processes. For example, Google created a cat-
identification system, which achieved impressive results in identifying cats on YouTube;
however, none of the system’s developers were able to determine which traits of a cat the system
was using in its identification process.218 This lack of so-called “explainability” is common across
all such AI algorithms. To address this issue, DARPA is conducting a five-year research effort to
produce explainable AI tools.219
Other research organizations are also attempting to do a backwards analysis of these types of
algorithms to gain a better understanding of their internal processes. In one such study,
researchers analyzed a program designed to identify curtains in images and discovered that the AI
algorithm first looked for a bed rather than a window, at which point it stopped searching the
image. Researchers later learned that this was because most of the images in the training data set
that featured curtains were bedrooms.220 The project demonstrated the possibility that training sets
could inadvertently introduce errors into a system that might not be immediately recognized or
understood by users.
Explainability can create additional issues in a military context, because the opacity of AI
reasoning may cause operators to have either too much or too little confidence in the system.
Some analysts are particularly concerned that humans may be averse to making a decision based
entirely on AI analysis if they do not understand how the machine derived the solution. Dawn

arguing, “Until AI can show me its homework, it’s not a decision quality product.”221 Increasing
explainability will thus be key to humans building appropriate levels of trust in AI systems. As a
U.S Army study of this issue concludes, only “prudent trust” will confer a competitive advantage
for military organizations.222
Additional human-machine interaction issues that may be challenged by insufficient
explainability in a military context include the following:
         Goal Alignment. The human and the machine must have a common
          understanding of the objective. As military systems encounter a dynamic
          environment, the goals will change, and the human and the machine must adjust
          simultaneously based on a shared picture of the current environment.223
         Task Alignment. Humans and machines must understand the boundaries of one
          another’s decision space, especially as goals change. In this process, humans
          must be consummately aware of the machine’s design limitations to guard
          against inappropriate trust in the system.224
         Human Machine Interface. Due to the requirement for timely decisions in
          many military AI applications, traditional machine interfaces may slow down
          performance, but there must be a way for the human and machine to coordinate
          in real time in order to build trust.225
Finally, explainability could challenge the military’s ability to “verify and validate” AI system
performance prior to fielding. Due to their current lack of an explainable output, AI systems do
not have an audit trail for the military test community to certify that a system is meeting
performance standards.226 DOD is currently developing a framework to test AI system lifecycles
and building methods for testing AI systems in diverse environments with complex human-
machine interactions.227 In August 2020, DOD awarded a $106 million contract to Deloitte
Consulting to build the JAIC’s Joint Common Foundation, which is to “provide an AI
development environment to test, validate, and field AI capabilities at scale across the
Department of Defense.”228
In addition, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence is to provide
recommendations for operationalizing predictability and explainability in AI systems. As the
interim report notes, “recommendations might include identifying gaps in current processes,
providing guidance on needed policy and technical standards, and identifying areas where future
R&D and workforce training is necessary.”229

Exploitation
AI systems present unique pathways for
adversary exploitation. First, the proliferation                    Figure 6. Adversarial Images
of AI systems will increase the number of
“hackable things,” including systems that
carry kinetic energy (e.g., moving vehicles),
which may in turn allow exploitive actions to
induce lethal effects. These effects could be
particularly harmful if an entire class of AI
systems all have the same exploitable
vulnerability.230
In addition, AI systems are particularly
vulnerable to theft by virtue of being almost
entirely software-based. As one analyst points
out, the Chinese may be able to steal the plans

the dual-use nature of the technology and the fact that the AI research community has been
relatively open to collaboration up to this point. Indeed, numerous AI tools developed for civilian
use—but that could be adapted for use in weapon systems—have been shared widely on
unclassified internet sites, making them accessible to major military powers and nonstate actors
alike.232
Finally, adversaries may be capable of deliberately introducing the kinds of image classification
and other errors discussed in the “Predictability” section above. In one such case, researchers who
had access to the training data set and algorithm for an image classifier on a semiautonomous
vehicle used several pieces of strategically placed tape (as illustrated in Figure 6) to cause the
system to identify a stop sign as a speed limit sign. In a later research effort, a team at MIT
successfully tricked an image classifier into thinking that a picture of machine guns was a
helicopter—without access to the system’s training data or algorithm.233 These vulnerabilities
highlight the need for robust data security, cybersecurity, and testing and evaluation processes as
military AI applications are developed.

AI’s Potential Impact on Combat
Although AI has not yet entered the combat arena in a serious way, experts are predicting the
potential impact that AI will have on the future of warfare. This influence will be a function of
many factors, including the rate of commercial investment, the drive to compete with
international rivals, the research community’s ability to advance the state of AI capability, the
military’s general attitude toward AI applications, and the development of AI-specific warfighting
concepts.234
Many experts assert that there is a “sense of inevitability” with AI, arguing that it is bound to be
substantially influential.235 Nevertheless, in January 2016, then-Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff General Paul Selva, intimated that it may be too early to tell, pointing out that DOD is
still evaluating AI’s potential. He stated, “The question we’re trying to pose now is, ‘Do the
technologies that are being developed in the commercial sector principally provide the kind of
force multipliers that we got when we combined tactical nuclear weapons or precision and
stealth?’ If the answer is yes, then we can change the way that we fight.... If not, the military will
seek to improve its current capabilities slightly to gain an edge over its adversaries.”236 There are
a range of opinions on AI’s trajectory, and Congress may consider these future scenarios as it
seeks to influence and conduct oversight of military AI applications.

Minimal Impact on Combat
While many analysts admit that military AI technology is in a stage of infancy, it is difficult to
find an expert who believes that AI will be inconsequential in the long run.237 However, AI critics
point to a number of trends that may minimize the technology’s impact. From a technical
standpoint, there is a potential that the current safety problems with AI will be insurmountable
and will make AI unsuitable for military applications.238 In addition, there is a chance the
perceived current inflection point in AI development will instead lead to a plateau. Some experts
believe that the present family of algorithms will reach its full potential in another 10 years, and
AI development will not be able to proceed without significant leaps in enabling technologies,
such as chips with higher power efficiency or advances in quantum computing.239 The technology
has encountered similar roadblocks in the past, resulting in periods called “AI Winters,” during
which the progress of AI research slowed significantly.
As discussed earlier, the military’s willingness to fully embrace AI technology may pose another
constraint. Many academic studies on technological innovation argue that military organizations
are capable of innovation during wartime, but they characterize the services in peacetime as large,

inflexible bureaucracies that are prone to stagnation unless there is a crisis that spurs action.240
Members of the Defense Innovation Board, composed of CEOs from leading U.S. commercial
companies, remarked in their most recent report, “DOD does not have an innovation problem, it
has an innovation adoption problem” with a “preference for small cosmetic steps over actual
change.”241
Another analysis asserts that AI adoption may be halted by poor expectation management. The
report asserts that overhyped AI capabilities may cause frustration that will “diminish people’s
trust and reduce their willingness to use the system in the future.”242 This effect could have a
significant chilling effect on AI adoption.

Evolutionary Impact on Combat
Most analysts believe that AI will at a minimum have significant impact on the conduct of
warfare. One study describes AI as a “potentially disruptive technology that may create sharp
discontinuities in the conduct of warfare,” further asserting that the technology may “produce
dramatic improvements in military effectiveness and combat potential.”243 These analysts point to
research projects to make existing weapon systems and processes faster and more efficient, as
well as providing a means to cope with the proliferation of data that complicate intelligence
assessments and decisionmaking. However, these analysts caution that in the near future AI is
unlikely to advance beyond narrow, task-specific applications that require human oversight.244
Some AI proponents contend that although humans will be present, their role will be less
significant, and the technology will make combat “less uncertain and more controllable,” as
machines are not subject to the emotions that cloud human judgment.245 However, critics point to
the enduring necessity for human presence on the battlefield in some capacity as the principle
restraining factor that will keep the technology from upending warfare. An academic study of this
trend argues
         At present, even an AI of tremendous power will not be able to determine outcomes in a
         complex social system, the outcomes are too complex – even without allowing for free will
         by sentient agents.... Strategy that involves humans, no matter that they are assisted by
         modular AI and fight using legions of autonomous robots, will retain its inevitable human
         flavor.246

Pointing to another constraining factor, analysts warn of the psychological impact that
autonomous systems will have on an adversary, especially in conflict with cultures that place a
premium on courage and physical presence. One study on this topic quotes a security expert from
Qatar who stated, “How you conduct war is important. It gives you dignity or not.”247
In addition, experts highlight that the balance of international AI development will affect the
magnitude of AI’s influence. As one analyst states, “[T]he most cherished attribute of military
technology is asymmetry.”248 In other words, military organizations seek to develop technological
applications or warfighting concepts that confer an advantage for which their opponent possesses
no immediate countermeasure. Indeed, that is the U.S. military’s intent with the current wave of
technological development as it seeks “an enduring competitive edge that lasts a generation or
more.”249 For this reason, DOD is concerned that if the United States does not increase the pace
of AI development and adoption, it will end up with either a symmetrical capability or a
capability that bestows only a fleeting advantage, as U.S. competitors like China and Russia
accelerate their own respective military AI programs.250
The democratization of AI technology will further complicate the U.S. military’s pursuit of an AI
advantage. As the 2018 National Defense Strategy warns, “The fact that many technological
developments will come from the commercial sector means that state competitors and nonstate
actors will also have access to them, a fact that risks eroding the conventional overmatch to which
our Nation has grown accustomed.”251 In these circumstances, AI could still influence warfighting
methods, but the technology’s overall impact may be limited if adversaries possess comparable
capabilities.

Revolutionary Impact on Combat
A sizeable contingent of experts believe that AI will have a revolutionary impact on warfare. One
analysis asserts that AI will induce a “seismic shift on the field of battle” and “fundamentally
transform the way war is waged.”252 The 2018 National Defense Strategy counts AI among a
group of emerging technologies that will change the character of war, and Frank Hoffman, a
professor at the National Defense University, takes this a step further, arguing that AI may “alter
the immutable nature of war.”253
Statements like this imply that AI’s transformative potential is so great that it will challenge long-
standing, foundational warfighting principles. In addition, members of the Chinese military

establishment assert that AI “will lead to a profound military revolution.”254 Proponents of this
position point to several common factors when making their case. They argue that the world has
passed from the Industrial Era of warfare into the Information Era, in which gathering, exploiting,
and disseminating information will be the most consequential aspect of combat operations.
In light of this transition, AI’s potential ability to facilitate information superiority and “purge
combat of uncertainty” will be a decisive wartime advantage, enabling faster and higher-quality
decisions.255 As one study of information era warfare states, “[W]inning in the decision space is
winning in the battlespace.”256 Members of this camp argue that AI and autonomous systems will
gradually distance humans from a direct combat role, and some even forecast a time in which
humans will make strategic-level decisions while AI systems exclusively plan and act at the
tactical level. In addition, analysts contend that AI may contest the current preference for quality
over quantity, challenging industrial era militaries built around a limited number of expensive
platforms with exquisite capabilities, instead creating a preference for large numbers of adequate,
less expensive systems.257
A range of potential consequences flow from the assumptions surrounding AI’s impact on
warfighting. Some studies point to overwhelmingly positive results, like “near instantaneous
responses” to adversary operations, “perfectly coordinated action,” and “domination at a time and
place of our choosing” that will “consistently overmatch the enemy’s capacity to respond.”258
However, AI may create an “environment where weapons are too fast, small, numerous, and
complex for humans to digest ... taking us to a place we may not want to go but are probably
unable to avoid.”259 In other words, AI systems could accelerate the pace of combat to a point in
which machine actions surpass the rate of human decisionmaking, potentially resulting in a loss
of human control in warfare.260
There is also a possibility that AI systems could induce a state of strategic instability. The speed
of AI systems may put the defender at an inherent disadvantage, creating an incentive to strike
first against an adversary with like capability. In addition, placing AI systems capable of
inherently unpredictable actions in close proximity to an adversary’s systems may result in
inadvertent escalation or miscalculation.261
Although these forecasts project dramatic change, analysts point out that correctly assessing
future impacts may be challenging. Historians of technology and warfare emphasize that previous
technological revolutions are apparent only in hindsight, and the true utility of a new application
like AI may not be apparent until it has been used in combat.262

Nevertheless, given AI’s disruptive potential, for better or for worse, it may be incumbent on
military leaders and Congress to evaluate the implications of military AI developments and
exercise oversight of emerging AI trends. Congressional actions that affect AI funding,
acquisitions, norms and standards, and international competition have the potential to
significantly shape the trajectory of AI development and may be critical to ensuring that advanced
technologies are in place to support U.S. national security objectives and the continued efficacy
of the U.S. military.
